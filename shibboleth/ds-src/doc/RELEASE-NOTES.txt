Changes in Release 1.1.1
=============================================
The major change in this release is the UI in particular the searching for IdPs can be done 
from within the browser (by way of a javascript class).  The old style searching is still 
supported and is used when the browser does not support javascript.  This means that the precise
effect of the provideList and provideListOfList configuration values for wayfconfig
have changed.  With the default JSP, the former controls whether the quick search is enabled, the
latter toggles whether the single or double pane selector is chosen. 

There is some support for prototyping of "embedded WAYF" code.

The precise Cases changed are.

[SDSJ-58] - Subtle bug to do with the default attribute handling and default end points. (2120)
[SDSJ-60] - Missed case normalization before search meant we missed some items.
[SDSJ-62] - Add Java script driver quick searching
[SDSJ-63] - UI GUI -changes - dynamic search and nascent embedded WAYF work
[SDSJ-64] - Needs to clean non printing whitespace from Organization DisplayName before outputing javascript arrays
[SDSJ-65] - Update libraries for release
