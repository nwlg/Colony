<!-- The default behaviour of Service is controlled via the elements
     and attributes below.  Non default behaviour is achieved by
     specifying any or all of these in the specific
     DiscoveryServiceHandler element.

     The handleCookie, cacheDomain and cacheExpiration attributes are
     no longer used.  Use the cookie plugin to configure the handling
     of the SAML cookie.

     The cacheExpiration attribute sets the expiration time of the
     cookie (if the 'Remember for a week' selection is made).

     The jspFile & errorJspFile attributes control the display

     The provideList attribute controls whether a single list of all
     possible IdPs is presented.  This also controls whether the
     Quick search dialog is presented.
     
     The provideListOfList attribute controls whether multiple lists
     are presented (one for each MetadataProvider). Rather than all
     the entities as one.

     The showUsableIdPs attribute controls the contents of the above
     lists.  The single list (provideList=true) is trimmed by
     excluding IdPs which do not share a metadata file with the SP.
     The multiple lists (provideListOfList=true) is trimmed by
     excluding all lists which do not specify the SP.
     
     The SearchIgnore element contains a list of words to be ignored while
     performing a search.
     
     warnOnBadBinding describes what to do iof the metadata has a badly 
     formed <DiscoveryResponse> false (or not present) means that the bad 
     SP is removed from the metadata and an error written to the log file.
     True means that we just noter this in the log file.
     THIS SETTING IS SYSTEM WIDE ONLY.

<!-- The MetadataProvider is in a similar syntax to that used to
     configure an IdP.  This means that plugins for the IdP can be
     used interchangably between the IdP and WAYF.

     The identifier element is used to uniquely distinguish the
     metadata in a Federation element below
     
     If an HTTP URL is provided for the name, a backingFile has to be provided.
     This is where the file will be spooled to locally.  This spooled file will
     be used if the DS cannot get hold of the 'real' data.

     The url below should be "file://C:\program files/metadata/sites.xml

     then the first handler for which the default attribute is set
